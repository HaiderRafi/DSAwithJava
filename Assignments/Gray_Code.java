Problem Statement
You are given a decimal number n. You need to find the gray code of the number n and convert it into decimal.

Binary to Gray conversion :
1. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the gray code is always equal to the MSB of the given binary code.
2. Other bits of the output gray code can be obtained by XORing binary code bit at that index and previous index.

Eg: Gray code of 01001 is 01101
Input
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer N denoting the number.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^9
Output
For each test case, print gray code equivalent of N in a separate line.
Example
Sample Input:
4
10
13
5
101

Sample Output:
15
11
7
87

Explanation:
5: 101 in binary
Gray: 111
