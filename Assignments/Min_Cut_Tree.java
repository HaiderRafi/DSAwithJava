Problem Statement
Given an integer K and an array height[] of size N, where height[i] denotes the height of the ith tree in a forest. The task is to make a cut of height X from the ground such that at max K units wood is collected. Find the minimum value of X
If you make a cut of height X from the ground then every tree with a height greater than X will be reduced to X and the remaining part of the wood can be collected
Input
The first line contains two integers N and K.
The next line contains N integers denoting the elements of the array height[]

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ K ≤ 107
Output
Print a single integer with the value of X.
Example
Sample Input:
4 2
1 2 1 2

Sample Output:
1

Explanation:
Make a cut at height 1, the updated array will be {1, 1, 1, 1} and
the collected wood will be {0, 1, 0, 1} i. e. 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
