/*
Print Pattern
easy
Problem Statement
Print a sequence of numbers starting with N, without using loop, in which A[i+1] = A[i] - 5, if A[i]>0, else A[i+1] = A[i] + 5 repeat it until A[i]=N.

Note:- Once you change a operation you need to continue doing it.
Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function PrintPattern() that takes the integer N and the integer curr (curr = N) and bool flag (flag = true) as a parameter.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
0 < N < 1000
Output
Print the pattern with space-separated integers.
Example
Sample Input:
2
16
10

Sample Output:
16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
10 5 0 5 10

Explanation:
We basically first reduce 5 one by one until we reach a negative or 0. After we reach 0 or negative, we one by one add 5 until we reach N.
